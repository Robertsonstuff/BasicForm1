# BasicForm1
This is a basic form that will print out results in a txt file in the same folder directory. In this case, it's will log first name, last name and age.
I'm using Python 3.8.3 which has Tkinter built in, this way you shouldn't need any dependencies to get this to work.
This is very basic but like me, it's the building block to expanding on an idea that you may have.
